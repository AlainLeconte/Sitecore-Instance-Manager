These folders are treated by SIM as plugins. 
- Each plugin must reside in its own folder. 
- Each plugin must contain "plugin.xml" file with the details

Please use stock plugins as examples - you may use Reflector or ILSpy or DotPeak to browse their source code

Please DO NOT create your own plugins here since they may be lost during next SIM update.

You are welcome to create them in the following folder instead:
%appdata%\sitecore\sitecore instance manager\plugins

There are two places where are manifest files are searched in:
- this Plugins folder
- %appdata%\sitecore\sitecore instance manager\plugins folder
